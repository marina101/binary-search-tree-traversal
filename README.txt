This program reads in a plain text file, extracts the words (without punctuation) and converts them into word objects, and then inputs them into a Binary Search Tree. The program then prints out several different traversals of the resulting BST:
-in-order
-level-order
-pre-order
-post-order
It also draws the BST rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. 

Special Instructions: 

Please make sure the text file is in the same directory as the program, or else a file not found exception will be thrown.

Note: the inspiration for the basic tree structure is derived from Clifford Shaffer’s “Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis” 3rd ed. (http://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/).
